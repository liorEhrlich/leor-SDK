# üí° What is Lord of the Rings SDK?

This project is an SDK over the [Lord of the rings API V2](https://the-one-api.dev/).

<br />

# ü§∏ Getting Started

## üíæ Installation
Install leor-lotr via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leor-lotr):

```shell
npm i leor-lotr
```

## üèá First run

First we create a new instance of the exported class. This instance will have all the methods for fetching current data on LOTR.

```javascript
const LOTRClient = require("leor-lotr");
const client = new LOTRClient("API_KEY");

const getAllLOTRBooks = async () => {
  const books = await client.books.get();
  console.log("These are all the LOTR books: ", books);
};

getAllLOTRBooks();
```

<br />


 # üß™ Tests

```shell

npm run test

```
